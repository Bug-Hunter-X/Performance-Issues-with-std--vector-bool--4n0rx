std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that uses a bit for each boolean value, rather than a full byte.  While this saves memory, it can lead to performance issues because accessing individual elements requires bit manipulation, which is slower than accessing bytes directly.  Additionally, many algorithms are not optimized for this specialized container, causing unexpected slowdowns or incorrect results.
