The issue with `std::vector<bool>` is that it's not a true vector.  Instead of using individual bytes to store each boolean value, it uses bit manipulation, which is less efficient and not optimized for many standard algorithms.  This can cause significant performance degradation.  To solve this, using a `std::vector<char>` or `std::vector<int>` is generally more efficient.  Each element will use a full byte (or 4 bytes for `int`), but the performance gains will typically outweigh the increase in memory usage.  Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

int main() {
  // Using std::vector<char> for better performance
  std::vector<char> boolVector(1000000); 

  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  for (size_t i = 0; i < boolVector.size(); ++i) {
    boolVector[i] = i % 2 == 0; // Setting values
  }
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);

  std::cout << "Time taken by std::vector<char>: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
